# Worlds

Worlds without ice present an extra challenge, as the following resources are typically obtained from ice mining:

- N2
- O2
- H2
- H2O
- N2O

Note that resources can be obtained from traders, but this is time consuming and not incredibly efficient.

## Moon / Mimas / Space

Vacuum means no wind power, but also very stable outdoor conditions. Gas recycling is important, and temperature management requires a lot of radiative heating/cooling.

- N2
  - Nitrice mining
- O2
  - Oxite mining
- H2
  - VolatileIce mining
- H2O
  - WaterIce mining
- N2O
  - Nitrice mining
- CO2
  - combustion/respiration byproduct
- X
  - combustion byproduct

## Mars

Very convenient atmosphere. Wind is nice for free power, but don't let the storms bully you. Gets cold at night.

- N2
  - Available in the atmosphere
- O2
  - Available in the atmosphere
- H2
  - VolatileIce mining
- H2O
  - WaterIce mining
- N2O
  - Nitrice mining
- CO2
  - Available in the atmosphere
- X
  - Available in the atmosphere

## Europa

Similar to mars, but the atmosphere isn't quite as easy to work with. It's very cold outside. Make sure you bundle your batteries up in their winter coats.

- N2
  - Nitrice mining
- O2
  - Available in the atmosphere
- H2
  - VolatileIce mining
- H2O
  - WaterIce mining
- N2O
  - Nitrice mining
- CO2
  - combustion/respiration byproduct
- X
  - combustion byproduct

## Vulcan

No ice, but a very convenient atmosphere. Some interesting potential for exploiting the day/night temperature shift for power generation.

- N2
  - Composter or offgas cobalt. Luckily not much consumes this.
- O2
  - Produce using plants + atmospheric CO2
- H2
  - Available in the atmosphere
- H2O
  - Combust atmospheric H2 + plant O2
- N2O
  - Nitrolyze N2 + O2 or offgas silver. Luckily optional.
- CO2
  - Available in the atmosphere
- X
  - Available in the atmosphere

## Venus

No ice, and a rather inconvenient atmosphere. A real shithole. Notably the pressure is high enough that composite/iron windows, glass doors, and iron walls are insufficient to support a vacuum chamber.

- N2
  - Available in the atmosphere
- O2
  - Produce using plants + atmospheric CO2
- H2
  - Recycle organics => biomass => offgas H2
- H2O
  - Combust biomass H2 + plant O2... is this actually sustainable?
- N2O
  - Nitrolyze N2 + O2 or offgas silver.
- CO2
  - Available in the atmosphere
- X
  - Available in the atmosphere

## Hypothetical Shithole World

An imaginary planet with no ice and some useless atmosphere, perhaps 100% X.

- N2
  - Composter or offgas cobalt. Luckily not much consumes this.
- O2
  - Plant respiration. Offgas gold?
- H2
  - Recycle organics => biomass => offgas H2
- H2O
  - Combust biomass H2 + plant O2... is this actually sustainable?
- N2O
  - Nitrolyze N2 + O2 or offgas silver. Luckily optional.
- CO2
  - **get fucked**. combustion/respiration byproduct. Burn coal? You NEED a shit ton of this for having your plants shit out O2. O2 is needed for a bunch of other reactions.
- X
  - combustion byproduct
